These documents contain all the collected ideas, for a mechanic codenamed "The Boredom Button".
The concept of which is described in this document.

The Boredom Button [afterwards referenced as TBB] is a button, which is to be placed easily reachable in the living room.
Whenever someone declares, that they're bored, TBB has to be pressed.
TBB is given a set of criteria, which can also be empty. It will then proceed to display a randomly chosen entry of it's database,
which is filled with boredom eliminating activities, which meets the criteria.
If TBB is pressed, the person or group pressing TBB has to participate in the chosen activity.
Since TBB accepts a well designed set of criteria, TBB should, if used correctly, always produce a pleasing result.
